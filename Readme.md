Create a simple shape editor.

Implement the following keystroke commands:
* r: Create a rectangle (size is up to you)
* c: A circle
* q: A square (special rectangle)

Create a data structure that holds:
* Shape type (i.e. name, like "circle")
* Shape origin (x and y) ... note the actual attributes will depend on the shape type, cx/cy for circles, rx/ry for rectangles.
* Other required attribute (like "r" for circle radius)
* Shape's fill color
* Shape's ID (recommend using "id"+n, where n is the nth shape created)

Allow the user to select a shape with the mouse:
* On click, find the shape that's nearest to the mouse location.
* Do NOT worry about making that search efficient. There's an entire field of computational geometry dedicated to that.
* Once a shape is selected, make it the "current shape".
* Identify the current shape by making it blink for two seconds (250 ms on/off)

Commands:
* m: Move the current shape. The next mouse click location becomes the new origin of the shape.
* 1: Make the current shape red
* 2: Make the current shape blue
* 3: Make the current shape green
* +: Increase the current shape size by 10%
* -: Decrease the current shape size by 10%
  
My implementation has functions that do the following
* findClosest: finds the shape closest to an x/y coordinate by checking the distances to each shape origin
* window.addEventListener: for keydown events. Has if/else to identify each command.
* For "m", adds an event listener for "mousedown". The event listener is defined in the "m" block, and it removes itself from the listener after it's been called. This prevents it from continuing to capture mouse events.
* toggleBlink: Blinks the selected shape on and off by toggling the fill between the original color and transparent.
* svg.addDeventListener: On "mousedown", finds the closest shape and then sets an interval using setInterval to call toggleBlink. Sets a timeout to clear the interval using clearInterval.
